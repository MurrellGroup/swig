# CHMMAIRRa PCR-chimera inference

## Input projection

CHMMAIRRa runs on V (default) or J for the current cumulative working set. Its reference input must be an equal-length aligned FASTA with at least two records. Swig can build this MSA from the exact assignment references using Kalign WASM or validate a user-supplied MSA.

For each AIRR row, Swig locates the assigned allele (or gene-level fallback) in the MSA. The local AIRR germline alignment is located in the degapped MSA reference; query insertions relative to that germline are removed, then the observed local query is threaded onto the allele's MSA columns. Outside observed coverage, gaps and `N` are non-informative emissions. A missing reference/alignment is reported as unevaluated rather than assigned an arbitrary posterior.

Distance from reference (DFR) exactly counts unequal characters in the AIRR local sequence/germline alignment up to their common length, including gap and `N` differences, following CHMMAIRRa's `add_DFR_column!`. Rows below the chosen DFR are not evaluated; the default minimum is 1.

## HMM

At each MSA column the hidden reference is one aligned allele. Under the discretized model, state also contains one of the configured mutation-rate bins. An informative observed nucleotide equals the state reference with probability \(1-\mu\) and each alternative nucleotide with probability \(\mu/3\). Gap/`N` observations contribute emission 1.

The transition probability of switching reference is the configured chimera prior divided by alignment length; transition to a different reference enters the `chimeric` state, which remains chimeric thereafter. Mutation-rate switching is modeled separately. A scaled forward pass returns posterior probability that the final path has switched reference at least once.

- **Baum–Welch (`BW`, IG default):** estimates one mutation probability per reference with smoothed expected match/mismatch counts, then evaluates the reference-switch posterior.
- **Discretized Bayesian (`DB`, TCR default):** marginalizes over the displayed mutation-rate grid. TCR starts with a single 0.005 rate; IG's default grid spans 0–0.25.

The run stores probabilities for all evaluated ordinals and only a bounded heap of the top 500 flagged records for interactive display. The threshold (0.95 default) is a decision layer; changing the later exclusion threshold does not rerun the HMM.

## Detailed reconstruction

Opening one flagged record reruns a full Viterbi traceback on demand. It reports the starting reference, each reference-switch boundary, complete reference path, and displayed parent sequences. The identity-highlighter colors query agreement with the displayed parents; color is not itself the hidden state. Triple-gap columns may be hidden from the SVG only, never from the HMM.

## Literature and code relationship

This is a **browser port of the CHMMAIRRa/CHMMera structured HMM**, including reference/rate states, absorbing chimera indicator, DFR convention, BW/DB modes, and posterior definition. Swig differs in its AIRR-to-MSA threading, browser worker orchestration, bounded top-record retention, optional J mode, and explicit cumulative-mask/filter UI. It is not claimed to be byte-for-byte identical to the Julia program. See Chernyshev et al., [Detection of PCR chimeras in adaptive immune receptor repertoire data](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/41/11/btaf576/8297098), and the [CHMMAIRRa.jl source](https://github.com/MurrellGroup/CHMMAIRRa.jl).

## Limitations

- The model explains template switching among references present in the MSA; missing parental alleles can distort inference.
- A high posterior is model evidence, not experimental confirmation of a PCR chimera.
- Mutation emissions are context independent.
- Filtering may retain unevaluated rows or exclude them, by explicit user choice.
- D segments are not modeled.
