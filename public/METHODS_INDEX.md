# Swig methods index

This index is the implementation-facing methods map for Swig 0.35.3. It covers every runnable analysis block from file intake through phylogenetic UCA inference. The UI may summarize a method in one sentence; the linked document is the specification.

## Evidence labels used in these documents

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Direct implementation** | Swig implements the stated equations or algorithm itself. It may still use different storage or parallelization. |
| **Browser port** | The scientific core is deliberately matched to named source code or a paper, with listed engineering differences. |
| **Compatible** | Swig reproduces a defined decision rule or output convention, but is not the named software. |
| **Custom** | The method is Swig-specific. Papers are context, validation targets, or sources of parameter values—not claims of identity. |

## Important scope distinctions

- V(D)J assignment is per rearranged sequence. Repertoire allele refinement is the optional first cross-record model.
- Applying a stage changes a typed downstream mask or a call overlay; it never deletes the immutable assigned AIRR rows.
- Default allele-model fits are within donor and may combine samples from that donor. Cross-donor scopes are explicit overrides.
- Collapse and lineage scopes are independent hard candidate-generation boundaries.
- The ordinary rooted tree and the phylogenetic UCA calculation are distinct. UCA inference removes the guide, fixes a tree of observed lineage sequences, then places an unobserved ancestor against that tree.

## Reproducibility

Saved sessions retain all settings needed to reproduce applied downstream state and store compact masks/vectors rather than a second AIRR table. Machine-readable outputs preserve original calls alongside any policy-selected calls. Defaults are starting values, not universal biological constants; each method document identifies the settings that require assay-, organism-, or dataset-specific sensitivity checks.
